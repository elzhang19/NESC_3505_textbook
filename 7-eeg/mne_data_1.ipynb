If you don't run this when using MNE, you will find that MNE provides a lot output, and often including some concerning-looking Python warning messages. Most of these warnings are safely ignored. I generally find this output more confusing than helpful, and turn it off routinely. For our lessons we will keep the output off because it just creates confusion. Many MNE comnmands have a `verbose` kwarg that allows you to change the amount of output a particular command generates. This can be useful if you want more information about what a command is doing; for example, some functions take a long time to run and you can increase the verbosity to see how far along the function is.\n",

    "## Import raw data\n",
    "\n",
    "For EEG, raw data is typically stored in a one or more files containing continuous EEG data. There are many different proprietary file formats for EEG data; most of these are developed by the manufacturer of a particular EEG system, since an integral part of an EEG system is software to save the data for later analysis. Fortunately, MNE provides functions to import data from most common EEG systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the present case, we are working with data from a system sold by Brain Products, whose software is called *Brain Vision*. So we will use MNE's `read_raw_brainvision()` function. The Brain Vision format actually specifies *three files* for any given data set. The three files are all created at the time that the EEG data is acquired, and it's important to ensure that all three are copied when moving them around. The files are as follows:\n",
    "- `*.eeg` is the actual EEG data (electrical potential measurements for all electrodes, at all time points). This is stored in a compressed (binary) format\n",
    "- `*.vmrk` is a text file containing all of the markers (*trigger codes*) that were sent to the EEG system during data collection, by the stimulus computer. These typically encode the onset of various stimuli, and times of any responses by the participant, as well as and what each stimulus/response was. \n",
    "- `*.vhdr` is a text file with header information, or **metadata** about the data set, including technical details such as the sampling rate, and the settings of the EEG amplifier during the recording. The `.vhdr` file is particularly important because it specifies the file names of the `.eeg` and `.vmrk` files (although they should always be named consistently with the header file). \n",
    "\n",
    "When we run `read_raw_brainvision()` the file we will actually pass as an argument is the `.vhdr` file. Since it specifies the names of the associated `.eeg` and `.vmrk` files, from this file MNE can find the data and markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As described previously, many of MNE's functions are nested inside subfolders (modules); for example, all of the file input-output (I/O) routines are in the module `mne.io`. So when we call the `read_raw_brainvision()` function, we have to do so as `mne.io.read_raw_brainvision()`. The one required argument for this function is the file name, and that's all we need for now: "

The header of a raw EEG data file contains its metadata (information about the file), as you saw above in printing out the `__dict__` this is often enough for MNE to perform some operations on the data.

For example, if we wanted the data from channel 15, but only from 1000 - 1100 ms, we would need to convert those times to samples, and then use those indices to slice the data. We can do this by multiplying the times (in seconds) by the sampling rate, and then converting the result to an integer (since the result of the multiplication will be a float), as shown bnelow. While this is not necessarily difficult, it's a bit tricky. It would be nice if we could work with our data in terms of uinits of time, and not samples."

    "Since we understand how to select a particular segment of data and return it as a NumPy array, it's eay to pass the result of doing this to Matplotlib, and visualize the electrical potential of a specific electrode over a segment of time. It's good practice to use variables to pass to the various kwargs we want to use in the plot command — this makes it easy to modify them as necessary. But since storing a slice of data could consume a lot of memory, it's better just to pass the slice directly to the plot command, as shown below.\n",

    "One thing to note here is the `.T` operator, which *transposes* the data array (i.e., swaps the rows and columns). To be honest, I didn't understand why this was — Matplotlib expects the data as rows (*x* axis) columns (*y* axis), which is how are data are shaped. So I asked Copilot Chat, and got the following answer:\n",

    "If we look at the axes of the plot below, we see that the *x* axis is time — but in units of samples, not seconds, with zero being the first sample (even though it's actually 1 s from the start of the recording). This is because we passed the data directly to Matplotlib, and it doesn't know anything about the sampling rate. We can fix this by passing the time values to the `x` kwarg, and the data to the `y` kwarg. We can get the time values by using the `linspace()` function from NumPy, which will return an array of evenly spaced values between the start and end times we specify. We can specify the start time as 1, and the end time as the length of the data divided by the sampling rate, as shown below. We can also specify the `ylim` kwarg to set the y-axis limits to a reasonable range.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- MNE can load raw EEG data from standard file formats, and stores the data in a `Raw` object. \n",
    "- The `Raw` object contains a lot of information about the data (metadata), but does not load the data into memory by default.\n",
    "- The metadata can be accessed using the `.info` attribute of the `Raw` object. Many other attribues fo the `Raw` object are visible using the `.__dict__` attribute\n",
    "- By default, MNE does not load the data into memory. We can load it either with the `preload` kwarg when reading the data, or by calling the `.load_data()` method of the `Raw` object\n",
    "- Since the raw data is stored in a NumPy array, we can access subsets of the data using standard NumPy indexing\n",
    "- Likewise, we can use Matpltlib to plot data from the NumPy array. When plotting a 1D NumPy array, we need to transpose it first, using `.T`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next lesson, we will learn how to use MNE's built-in functions and methods for visualization. These are much more convenient, because they allow you to think of your data in specifically EEG/MNE terms, rather than metnally translating between EEG concepts and NumPy arrays. MNE automatically does thinks like converting samples to time, and taking inputs as challen labels and times in seconds, rather than numerical indexes of NumPy arrays.\n"
